This role allows for the deployment and management of
[Sensu Go](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-go).

Modules are a work in progress
------------------------------

While the initial role completely handles installing and running Sensu Go's
`sensu-agent`, `sensu-backend`, and `sensuctl` there is still a lot of work
left to do.

- [ ] Adding/Deleting/Modifying Checks

- [ ] Adding/Deleting/Modifying organizations/environments

- [ ] Adding/Deleting/Modifying roles

- [ ] Adding/Deleting/Modifying filters

- [ ] Adding/Deleting/Modifying mutators

- [ ] Adding/Deleting/Modifying handlers

- [ ] Adding/Deleting/Modifying silences

- [ ] Adding/Deleting/Modifying hooks

The current focus is adding/deleting/modifying checks. Currently, there's a
work in progress Ansible module included in `library/` for this. Until the Sensu
Go API is versioned/documented/stable, we are wrapping `sensuctl` for our
interactions with Sensu Go.

If you'd like to contribute, please review [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/jaredledvina/sensu-go-ansible/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and open an issue to discuss your
idea.

Requirements
------------

* Ansible 2.7 or higher

Role Variables
--------------

See `defaults/main.yml` for everything that's configurable.
Please note that unless you've [configured `hash_behaviour` to `merge`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#default-hash-behaviour)
configuring any of the hash variables will **override** the entire default variable.

Most variables expose an `_overrides: {}` variable that is merged automatically
in this role for selectively updating each variable. It's strongly recommended
that the `overrides` variable be used.

Dependencies
------------

None

Example Playbook
